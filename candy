  <h1>The Negative Effects of Candy on Youth</h1>
  <h2>By Ali Cheraghi</h2>
  <p>Candy is a popular treat that is enjoyed by people of all ages, but it can have negative effects on youth in particular. It is important for youth to be aware of these effects and to consume candy in moderation.</p>
  <h3>Tooth Decay</h3>
  <p>One of the most well-known negative effects of candy is its contribution to tooth decay. Candy is high in sugar, and when it is consumed, the sugar combines with bacteria in the mouth to produce acid. This acid attacks the teeth, leading to tooth decay and cavities. According to the American Dental Association, the average American consumes 22 teaspoons of sugar per day, and a large portion of this sugar comes from candy and other sweets.</p>
  <h3>Obesity</h3>
  <p>Another negative effect of candy is its potential to contribute to obesity. Candy is high in calories, and when consumed in excess, it can lead to weight gain and obesity. This is particularly true for youth, who may not have fully developed habits around healthy eating and exercise. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, childhood obesity has more than doubled in children and quadrupled in adolescents in the past 30 years.</p>
  <h3>Diabetes</h3>
  <p>Candy can also contribute to the development of diabetes, a chronic disease that affects the way the body processes sugar. When people consume too much sugar, it can lead to insulin resistance and ultimately, diabetes. This is a particular concern for youth, who may not be aware of the long-term health consequences of their food choices. According to the World Health Organization, the number of people with diabetes has quadrupled since 1980, and it is estimated that by 2045, 629 million people will have diabetes worldwide.</p>
  <h3>Conclusion</h3>
  <p>While candy can be a tasty treat, it is important to consume it in moderation and be aware of the negative effects it can have on youth. Encouraging healthy eating habits and moderation in candy consumption can help youth avoid some of the negative consequences associated with this treat. It is also important for youth to be aware of the importance of oral hygiene and to brush and floss regularly to prevent tooth decay.</p>
